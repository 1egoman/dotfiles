# Ryan's Dotfiles

A collection of my dotfiles. I aim to maintain compatibility with the latest Ubuntu LTS and macOS
release, though some commands may be only designed to work on one platform or another.

# Set me up
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1egoman/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
